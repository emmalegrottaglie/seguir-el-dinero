/**
 * The line under a chart that says where its numbers came from.
 *
 * Every figure on this site cites the body that produced it, and until now each
 * chart wrote that line by hand, which meant the wording drifted and one chart
 * carried a period the data no longer matched. Taking the source record itself
 * removes both failures: the period and the table number are whatever the
 * ingest recorded, not whatever was typed.
 *
 * `note` is for what the reader must know to read the chart correctly — a
 * definition that differs from the obvious one, a population the figure
 * excludes. It renders collapsed, one click below the citation, via `Caveat`:
 * the sentence used to sit here fully expanded on every chart on the site,
 * which read as noise on the pages that had several. Nothing in `note` is
 * shortened for this — the full sentence is still there, just not forced on
 * every reader who already trusts the number.
