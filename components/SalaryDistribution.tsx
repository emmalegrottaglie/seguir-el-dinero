/**
 * One person's pay against every published figure in the register.
 *
 * The page used to print a euro figure and stop, which asks the reader to judge
 * whether €31,200 is a lot for a public post in Spain. Almost nobody can. This
 * puts the figure on the distribution it came from, so the judgement is made by
 * looking rather than guessed.
 *
 * The axis is logarithmic because the data spans four orders of magnitude and a
 * linear axis would compress 93 % of the register into the first eighth of the
 * width. Logarithmic axes mislead when a reader reads distance as difference,
 * so every decade is ticked and labelled, and the marker prints the exact
 * figure rather than relying on its position.
 *
 * The histogram is `aria-hidden`; the sentence beneath it carries the same
 * finding — rank, denominator and median — in text.
