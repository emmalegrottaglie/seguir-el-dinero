/**
 * What fraction of each dataset is populated, as a picture.
 *
 * Every other chart on this site shows what the data says. This one shows how
 * much of it there is, which is the claim the methodology page has been making
 * in prose. A reader can check the sentence against the bar.
 *
 * Deliberately not ranked or scored. These four ratios measure different things
 * against different registers — a portrait is a licensing outcome, a roll-call
 * record is a fact about who sits in the Congreso — so ordering them by
 * percentage would invite a comparison that means nothing. They run in the
 * order a reader meets them on the site.
 *
 * The bars are `share`: each is a part of its own whole, and the unfilled track
 * is the gap. That is the one case on this site where the *empty* part of a bar
 * is the subject.
