// The party-linked foundation channel: who pays into it, and who audits it.
//
// Extracted by scripts/extract-foundations.py from Tribunal de Cuentas report
// nº 1.642 (approved 25/09/2025), which audits one dossier per entity per
// exercise. The extractor recomputes every table's arithmetic and reconciles
// the dossiers against the report's own annex totals, aborting on a mismatch,
// so these figures agree with the report by construction.
//
// Why this channel exists at all. Political parties may take no corporate
// money: LO 8/2007 art. 5 bars donations from legal entities, bars anonymous
// donations, caps an individual at €50,000 a year and obliges a party to refuse
// a donor holding a live public contract. Their foundations are governed
// instead by disposición adicional séptima, under which legal entities *may*
// donate — over €120,000 by public deed, every corporate donation notified to
// the Tribunal within three months and the donor's identity published.
//
// What the audited figures actually show is not a corporate channel, though.
// Roughly nine tenths of the money entering these entities comes from the
// parties themselves, and corporate donations are under five per cent of it.
// The page says so rather than implying otherwise.
