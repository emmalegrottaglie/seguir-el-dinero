/**
 * One search across everything this site publishes.
 *
 * Until now a reader had to know which of eleven pages held the thing they were
 * looking for: an officeholder is on one page, the party that funds them on
 * another, the foundation that party owns on a third, and the comunidad they
 * govern on a fourth. That is a map of the site's internals, not of the
 * reader's question.
 *
 * It runs on the server, over the same module-cached data the pages use. That
 * is the whole reason it is cheap: the register alone is 6,670 rows and about
 * 1.8 MB, and shipping an index of it to every visitor to get a typeahead would
 * cost every reader far more than it saves the few who search. The search page
 * is a plain form GET, so it works without JavaScript, it is linkable, and the
 * browser announces the change of context — the same shape `/politicos`
 * already uses.
 *
 * What it does not do, and what the page says it does not do: it matches names
 * and titles, not the text of the reports behind them. A search for a word that
 * appears only inside a Tribunal de Cuentas finding will not find it, and
 * pretending otherwise would send a reader away believing the word is not
 * there.
