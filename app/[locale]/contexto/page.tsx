/**
 * The country the money is being spent in.
 *
 * Every other page here is about parties, officeholders and what they are paid.
 * None of those figures means anything without a scale, and the scale is not
 * this project's to invent: it is INE's, ingested by `scripts/fetch-ine.mjs`.
 *
 * What this page deliberately does not do is join the two. There is no line
 * drawn from a poverty rate to a vote, no correlation, no ordering of parties by
 * anything computed from these numbers. The rule this layer was designed under
 * is factual juxtaposition: the figures sit near each other and the reader does
 * the joining, because a line drawn here would be an assertion the data cannot
 * carry.
